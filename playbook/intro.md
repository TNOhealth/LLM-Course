# Welcome to the online course - beginners guide prompt engineering for TNO employees

</br>

This course is developed for TNO employees who are relatively new to the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and want to learn how to efficiently make use of these models for example via the application ChatGPT. This ‘art’ is also known as ‘prompt engineering’, a skill that did not exist till late 2023 when OpenAI made ChatGPT available to the general public. The course will cover the basics of prompt engineering and how it can be used to create complex prompt-based applications for scientific research, writing, communication, programming and data science, project leader and business development skills. The use of this models is sometimes referred to a as ‘augmented intelligence’, it holds the potential to make smart people even more smarter.

## For whom
This course aims particular to TNO employees who are not familiar yet with the use of GenAI and LLMs in particular. This online course will help make you help the first steps in use of GenAI to write or improve texts or to brainstorm and help you create new ideas. 

## How to use

This playbook can be traversed using the navigation bar to the left, where the individual chapters and sections are linked. Any page can be freely bookmarked and will return you to the page you were. In addition, at the bottom of the page you can switch to the previous or next page. Finally, there is a search bar available that can be used to search for specific terms across all pages. 

## Content

Just like GenAI itself, the content of this course will be updated on a regular pace: 
The playbook is developed around four important themes that may be addressed separately within the playbook. The major building blocks for health data ecosystems are as follows: 

*  Short introduction into LLMs and prompt engineering
*  Guidelines to use GenAI within TNO
*  prompting techniques
*  brainstorm example
*  usefull links and courses

You can navigate this book by using the menu to the right, or by flipping pages at the bottom of each section.

## Health data sharing in practice
Even though large scale adoptation of health data ecosystems is yet to be achieved, there are numerous examples of projects that have achieved and succesfully demonstrated safe, reliable, secure and ethical sharing of health data (insights) in an ecosystem setting. Some examples can be found here:

* [C4Yourself(Dutch)](https://www.tno.nl/nl/newsroom/insights/2022/06/kies-decentrale-aanpak-hergebruik/)
* [Ecosystems as a services (artikel A.I. voorbeeld)](https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000011)

## Call to action
Reusing health data is not an easy task. And setting up an ecosystem is not something done alone. We can help! TNO is active in many public-private partnerships and other collaborations with SMEs to setup health data ecosystems. We are actively looking for new partners in these and new projects.
