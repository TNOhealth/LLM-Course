The figure above shows the three approaches: Copy and Download, Researcher to Data and finally Model to Data, these models provide increasing capacity for security, reliability and privacy while also being increasing complexity to implement. 

Depending on the specific needs and requierments for subsequent analysis, a balance may be struck between implementation feasibility and requirements for security, privacy and reliability. In the following pages we will describe these approaches and both their advantages and disadvantages in a bit more detail.
